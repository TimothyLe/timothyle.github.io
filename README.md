I have recently taken on the framework 'Bootstrap' and have some experimentation occurring with it.  
You can find my work from Bootstrap here:  
• [Timothy Le Bootstrap](https://timothyle.github.io/pages/page.html)   

The jQuery javascript library has also been a work of interest for me and I plan on implementing in animations for buttons, jumbotron, navbar, and more. I will follow up this readme with further updates.
